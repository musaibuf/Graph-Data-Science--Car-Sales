## Graph Analytics Queries

1. **Information Travel Through Network:**  
   Find the most frequently traveled paths by vehicles moving from sellers to states.

2. **Influential Nodes in Information Spread:**  
   - Rank sellers by the number of vehicles they have sold.  
   - Identify states that have sold the most vehicles, thereby influencing the spread of market trends and vehicle popularity.

3. **Node Interaction Analysis:**  
   Identify which states have the most vehicles sold by a specific seller.

4. **Graph Network Patterns:**  
   Identify patterns, such as which vehicle makes are most commonly sold by each seller.

5. **Path Finding in the Graph:**  
   Find the shortest path between two nodes.

6. **Node Centrality:**  
   Identify nodes with the most influence using Degree Centrality.

7. **Community Detection:**  
   Detect communities within the graph using the Louvain algorithm.

8. **Influence Spread (PageRank):**  
   Identify which sellers or states have the most influence over the vehicle sales network.

9. **Interaction Patterns (Degree Centrality):**  
   Quantify the number of sales interactions for each seller or vehicle.

10. **Strongly Connected Components:**  
    Find clusters or groups of nodes that frequently interact with each other.

11. **Node Similarity:**  
    Use node similarity algorithms to identify nodes sharing similar characteristics or connectivity patterns. This can help identify sellers who operate similarly or vehicles that often follow similar sales patterns.
