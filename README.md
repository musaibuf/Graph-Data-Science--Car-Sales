# Vehicle Sales Network Analysis and Prediction

This repository hosts the project for CS343: Graph Data Science at Habib University, Spring 2024. The project involves constructing a graph database using Neo4j to model and analyze vehicle sales data, with an emphasis on link prediction and node classification through machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The project explores the relationships between sellers and vehicle sales across various states, using graph-based analytics to predict and classify data points within a Neo4j graph database. Insights derived from this project aim to predict potential vehicle sales and seller activities, enhancing understanding of market dynamics.

## Structure

- `LP.py`: Python script for link prediction analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python libraries.
- `Neo4jSetup.cypher`: Cypher queries for setting up the Neo4j database.
- `DataModel`: Folder containing the data model and sample data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Neo4j 4.0+ with APOC plugin
- Virtual environment recommended (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-sales-prediction.git
   cd vehicle-sales-prediction
