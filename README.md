# Vehicle Sales Network Analysis and Prediction

This repository hosts the project for CS343: Graph Data Science at Habib University, Spring 2024. The project involves constructing a graph database using Neo4j to model and analyze vehicle sales data, with an emphasis on link prediction and node classification through machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The project explores the relationships between sellers and vehicle sales across various states, using graph-based analytics to predict and classify data points within a Neo4j graph database. Insights derived from this project aim to predict potential vehicle sales and seller activities, enhancing understanding of market dynamics.
