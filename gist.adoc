== Introduction to Project

The vehicle sales analysis project involves constructing a graph database using Neo4j to model and analyze vehicle sales data, focusing on link prediction and node classification through machine learning techniques.

== Data Loading Script

To populate the graph database with relevant data, this Cypher script loads vehicles, sellers, and states and establishes relationships between them.

----
// Create Vehicles, Sellers, and States
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///car_prices.csv' AS row

// Create Vehicles
CREATE (:Vehicle {
    year: toInteger(row.year),
    make: row.make,
    model: row.model,
    trim: row.trim,
    body: row.body,
    transmission: row.transmission,
    vin: row.vin,
    color: row.color,
    interior: row.interior,
    condition: toInteger(row.condition),
    odometer: toInteger(row.odometer),
    mmr: toInteger(row.mmr),
    selling_price: toInteger(row.sellingprice),
    sale_date: datetime(row.saledate)
})

// Create Sellers
MERGE (s:Seller { name: row.seller })

// Create States
MERGE (st:State { name: row.state })

// Create Relationships
WITH row
MATCH (v:Vehicle { vin: row.vin })
MATCH (s:Seller { name: row.seller })
MERGE (v)-[:SOLD_BY]->(s)

WITH row
MATCH (v:Vehicle { vin: row.vin })
MATCH (st:State { name: row.state })
MERGE (v)-[:SOLD_IN]->(st)

WITH row
MATCH (s:Seller { name: row.seller })
MATCH (st:State { name: row.state })
MERGE (s)-[:OPERATES_IN]->(st)

WITH row
MATCH (s:Seller { name: row.seller })
MATCH (st:State { name: row.state })
MERGE (st)-[:HAS_SELLER]->(s)

WITH row
MATCH (s:Seller { name: row.seller })
MATCH (v:Vehicle { vin: row.vin })
MERGE (s)-[:SELLS]->(v)

WITH row
MATCH (st:State { name: row.state })
MATCH (v:Vehicle { vin: row.vin })
MERGE (st)-[:SELLS_IN]->(v)
----

== Graph Statistical Queries
=== Total Number of Nodes by Type
----
MATCH (v:Vehicle) RETURN COUNT(v) AS TotalVehicles
MATCH (s:Seller) RETURN COUNT(s) AS TotalSellers
MATCH (st:State) RETURN COUNT(st) AS TotalStates
----

Total Relationships by Type
----
MATCH ()-[r:SOLD_BY]->() RETURN COUNT(r) AS TotalSoldByRelationships
MATCH ()-[r:SELLS]->() RETURN COUNT(r) AS TotalSellsRelationships
MATCH ()-[r:OPERATES_IN]->() RETURN COUNT(r) AS TotalOperatesInRelationships
MATCH ()-[r:HAS_SELLER]->() RETURN COUNT(r) AS TotalHasSellerRelationships
----
Most Common Vehicle Makes
----
MATCH (s:Seller)-[:SELLS]->(v:Vehicle)
RETURN s.name AS Seller, v.make AS Make, COUNT(*) AS Count
ORDER BY Count DESC
LIMIT 10
----
== Graph Analytics Queries

=== Information Travel Through Network
Find the most frequently traveled paths by vehicles moving from sellers to states.
----
MATCH (v:Vehicle)-[:SOLD_IN]->(st:State)
RETURN v, st
ORDER BY v.year DESC
----
Influential Nodes in Information Spread

Rank sellers by the number of vehicles they have sold.
----
MATCH (s:Seller)-[:SELLS]->(v:Vehicle)
RETURN s, count(v) AS VehicleCount
ORDER BY VehicleCount DESC
----

Node Interaction Analysis
Identify which states have the most vehicles sold by a specific seller.
----
MATCH (s:Seller)-[:SELLS]->(v:Vehicle)-[:SOLD_IN]->(st:State)
RETURN st.name AS State, count(v) AS VehicleCount
ORDER BY VehicleCount DESC
----

Node Centrality Analysis

Find nodes with the most influence using Degree Centrality.
----
CALL gds.degree.stream('myGraphProjection')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Node, score AS DegreeCentrality
ORDER BY DegreeCentrality DESC
----

Community Detection
Identify communities within the graph using the following Louvain algorithm.
----
CALL gds.louvain.stream('myGraphProjection')
YIELD nodeId, communityId
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS Node, communityId
ORDER BY communityId
----

== Node Classification and Prediction

Machine Learning Implementation

This section provides information on node classification and prediction using machine learning.
----
CALL gds.graph.project('vehicleGraph', ['Vehicle', 'Seller', 'State'], {
  SOLD_BY: {type: 'SOLD_BY'},
  SOLD_IN: {type: 'SOLD_IN'},
  SELLS: {type: 'SELLS'},
  OPERATES_IN: {type: 'OPERATES_IN'},
  HAS_SELLER: {type: 'HAS_SELLER'},
  SELLS_IN: {type: 'SELLS_IN'}
})

CALL gds.fastRP.write('vehicleGraph', {
  embeddingDimension: 128,
  writeProperty: 'embedding'
})

MATCH (v:Vehicle)
RETURN v.vin AS id, v.embedding AS embedding, v.color AS color
----
The following Python script fetches vehicle embeddings from Neo4j, processes them, and uses a RandomForest model to predict vehicle color:

        data = result.data()
    driver.close()
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Query to fetch the vehicle embeddings and colors

"""

# Fetching data from Neo4j
df = fetch_embeddings_from_neo4j(uri, user, password, query)

# Expanding the embeddings from list to columns
embeddings_df = pd.DataFrame(df['embedding'].tolist())
embeddings_df['color'] = df['color']

# Cleaning the data to remove null colors
embeddings_df = embeddings_df.dropna(subset=['color'])

# Splitting the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = embeddings_df.drop('color', axis=1)
y = embeddings_df['color']

# Using RandomOverSampler to oversample minority classes
oversampler = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = oversampler.fit_resample(X, y)

# Splitting into training and testing datasets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Creating and training a RandomForestClassifier model

# Evaluating the model with a classification report
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, zero_division=1))

# Saving the trained model for later use
joblib.dump(model, 'best_vehicle_color_model.joblib')

# Function for new predictions
def predict_vehicle_color(model, new_embedding):
    return model.predict([new_embedding])
